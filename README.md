R001 EWB Digital Design Challenge (Individual)
Learning outcomes·   Apply skills and knowledge from a wide range of subjects to develop a solution to a problem.·   Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.SpecificationOverview
You will work to identify problems from the brief and propose a single solution for the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) digital challenge. This solution will be designed to solve a local problem or aid the local community. The solution will be contextually aware of the local requirements and the issues and problems they face.
Your final submission   will include:·   Client Report (3000 words) written in LaTeX or Word - covering an overview of your system and decision making
Please note this is an individual assignment.
This assignment must be based on a different problem than your group created a solution for during the project.
Description
You will discuss a single problem in the region which you have identified from the design brief and design a software prototype to help solve this. This problem must be different from the problem your synoptic project group solved.
You are required to produce supporting documentation in the style. of a client report. The client report should include your decision making, how your software system might function, this may include diagrams and/or pseudocode. Your report should include rationale for how you solve the problem you have identified and how your software can be deployed and tested to ensure it will help the region.
You should describe in your report the potential problems that people in the region will have accessing your solution and discuss some solutions to these problems.
Relationship to formative assessment
This project is designed to utilise and demonstrate the application of the skills you have developed throughout your studies. This is an opportunity to put your practice into action, by applying these skills in a real world scenario.
Deliverables
Client Report (3000 words)
Using your knowledge of systems development and/or software engineering methodologies and documentation you need to write a 3000-word client report which discusses a solution to a problem set out in this year’s EWB design brief.
This client report should describe and critically analyse an issue or problem you have identified in the region, using information from the brief. You should briefly discuss what causes this problem, and why technology is able to assist in solving it.
You should propose a technological s代 写R001 EWB Digital Design ChallengeC/C++

You need to provide UML diagrams to illustrate your prototype, or if your prototype depends on more than one piece of software you could include layer or stack diagrams, along with requirements gathering, design decisions and proposed user testing. You could also include lo-fi diagrams, and other sketches, to show the application interface.
Your report should include discussion of the potential problems that the people in the region could face when attempting to access your solution, and how you will mitigate these problems and provide solutions.
Your documentation could   include discussion and explanation of the tools and libraries you would choose to produce your solution.
Your documentation will   include analysis of the problem domain, and research to evidence and defend the decisions you have made with respect to the brief.
You do not need to program your solution or implement it.
Resources·   You will be able to build on the skills gained from systems development and/or software engineering·   If you have any questions, please contact the project organiser, Sally Earl ([email   protected]).
Plagiarism, collusion and contract cheatingThe University takes academic integrity very seriously. You must not commit plagiarism, collusion, or contract cheating in your submitted work. Our Policy on Plagiarism, Collusion, and Contract Cheating explains:   ·   what is meant by the terms ‘plagiarism’, ‘collusion’, and ‘contract cheating’   ·   how to avoid plagiarism, collusion, and contract cheating   ·   using a proof reader   ·   what will happen if we suspect that you have breached the policy.   It is essential that you read this policy and you undertake (or refresh your memory of) our school’s training on this. You can find the policy and related guidance here: https://my.uea.ac.uk/departments/learning-and-teaching/students/academic-cycle/regulations-and-discipline/plagiarism-awareness   The policy allows us to make some rules specific to this assessment. Note that:   In this assessment, working with others is not permitted. All aspects of your submission, including but not limited to: research, design, development and writing, must be your own work according to your own understanding of the topics. Please pay careful attention to the definitions of contract cheating, plagiarism and collusion in the policy and ask your module organiser if you are unsure about anything.
